# goTezos: A Tezos Go Library

The purpose of this library is to allow developers to build go driven applications for Tezos of the Tezos RPC. This library is a work in progress, and not complete. 

If you would like to send me some coffee money:

```


More robust documentation will come soon.

## Installation
```
go get github.com/DefinitelyNotAGoat/goTezos
```

To use the library import it into your go application:
```
import "github.com/DefinitelyNotAGoat/goTezos"
```


## goTezos Documentation

[GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/DefinitelyNotAGoat/goTezos)

The goTezos Library requires you to set the RPC URL for a node to query. 


Usage:

```
goTezos.SetRPCURL(url);
```

I will create a wiki shortly describing the functions available.
